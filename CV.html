<h3  id="Personal Profile">Personal Profile</h3>
<p>I consider myself a confident, motivated and reliable young person. I always attempt to complete any given task to the best of my ability. Throughout the last few years of my life I have completed many different tasks that I am very
proud of, an example is Duke of Edinburgh.I have been meeting people within the community during times when I helped for Remembrance Day at Tower of London which gave me an insight on the different groups of people in the community.</p>

<h3 > Skills & Abilities </h3>
<p> <b> Communication: </b> <br> I have worked in many public speaking roles where I am constantly facing new
customers. I have worked in events and promotions which required me to be in a different environment,
doing a different role as regularly as every day. This allowed me to learn a wide range of skills and I have
found it easy to adapt to any job given to me. I pick up the qualities needed very quickly as I am a quick
  learner. </p>
<p> <b> Teamwork: </b> <br> In most of the jobs I have worked in, I have been fortunate enough to work as part of a team. This has been great for me as I believe I am a good team player as well as reliable especially when it comes to supporting my team. I shine the most when I am around people with the same goals as me and I have been told that I am easy to work with. </p>
<p> <b> Coding: </b> <br> I have been coding using Python for nearly 4 years and have become confident as I am now able to complete some tasks using Python while under pressure. I have also been taking courses to learn new languages such as C++. </p>
